# Food App

**Introduction**

This Food App allows users to browse a delicious menu, select their favorite dishes, add them to a cart, and conveniently purchase them. Developed using Android Studio with Java and XML, the app provides a seamless food ordering experience.

**Features**

* **Explore a Detailed Menu:** Browse a visually appealing menu showcasing various food items with enticing descriptions and prices. 
* **Select Your Favorites:** Easily add individual dishes or entire categories to your cart with a simple tap or click.
* **Manage Your Cart:** View the contents of your cart, including quantities and prices for each item. 
* **Calculate Total Bill:** Get a real-time breakdown of your total bill amount based on the selected items and their prices. 
* **Complete Your Order (Optional):** Integrate a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to enable users to complete their purchases seamlessly (implementation details might vary depending on the chosen gateway).
* **Manage User Accounts (Optional):** Allow users to create accounts for saved orders, favorites, and order history tracking (additional development required).

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Android Studio (latest version recommended): Download and install from https://developer.android.com/studio
    * Basic understanding of Java and Android development: Online tutorials and resources abound.

2. **Cloning the Repository:**
    * If you have Git installed:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/vvishwa5524/Food-App.git](https://github.com/vvishwa5524/Food-App.git)
        ```
    * Otherwise, download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.

3. **Opening the Project:**
    - Open the cloned directory (`Food-App`) in Android Studio.

4. **Running the App:**
    - Ensure your device or emulator is connected and ready for development.
    - Click the "Run" button (green play triangle) in the toolbar.
    - Select your desired device or emulator.

**Project Structure**

(Assuming a standard Android Studio structure)

* `app`: Contains the main application code, resources, and configuration.
    - `java`: Java source code files for the app's functionality (e.g., `MainActivity.java`, `MenuItem.java`, etc.)
    - `res`: Resources such as layouts, images, strings, styles, etc.
        - `layout`: XML layout files for the app's user interface (e.g., `activity_main.xml`, `fragment_menu.xml`, etc.)
        - `drawable`: Images for use in the app's UI.
        - `values`: Strings, styles, and other resource files.
    - `AndroidManifest.xml`: Configures the app's basic information, permissions, and components.

**Tech Stack**

* Programming Language: Java
* Development Environment: Android Studio
* Layout Files: XML

**Further Development**

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

* Implement a working payment gateway for real purchases.
* Integrate user authentication and account management for saved orders and favorites.
* Add order history and tracking functionalities.
* Enhance the user interface with more advanced features like animations and responsive layouts.
* Consider accessibility features for better usability.
* Explore integrating with third-party delivery APIs for wider reach (optional).
